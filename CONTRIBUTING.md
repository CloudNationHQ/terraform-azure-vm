# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest. Hereâ€™s how to contribute:

## Issues
Use the feature or bug issue template when creating issues to ensure clarity and consistency.

## Pull Requests
Make changes in a fork of our repository and submit a pull request for review. Ensure your changes address a specific issue and include a clear description of the problem and solution.

## Commit Guidelines
For minor updates, start branch names with `feat/` and for patches, use `fix/`. For changes that introduce major increments and are not backward compatible, use a specific branch naming convention that clearly indicates the major change.

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format by prefixing your commits with `feat:` for new features or `fix:` for bug fixes. Ensure your commit messages clearly describe the changes.

## Release Process
Once approved, multiple pull requests may be included in a release pull request. After this collective release PR is merged, a github release is generated.

The new release will then be available in both the HashiCorp and OpenTofu registries, making it accessible for wider distribution and use.

We look forward to your contributions.
